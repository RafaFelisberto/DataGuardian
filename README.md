# DataGuardian — Intelligent Personal Data Leak Monitor

A project designed to automatically detect **sensitive personal data** (such as CPF, email, passwords, etc.) in files like **CSV, JSON, TXT, and SQL dumps**, helping in the proactive identification of potential data leaks.

## 🔍 Key Features

- [x] File upload support (CSV, JSON, TXT, SQL)
- [x] Automatic detection of sensitive data using **Regex + NLP**
- [x] Identification of suspicious patterns (e.g. passwords in logs, exposed keys)
- [x] Interactive dashboard with risk visualization
- [ ] Email alert system *(in development)*
- [ ] Automatic encryption of critical fields *(in development)*

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Streamlit** – Interactive UI framework
- **Pandas** – Data processing and analysis
- **spaCy** – Natural Language Processing for contextual detection
- **Fernet (Cryptography)** – Secure field encryption
- **Regex** – Pattern-based data detection

## 🧪 Detected Sensitive Data Types

The system can automatically identify the following types of sensitive information:

| Data Type         | Example                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| CPF               | 123.456.789-09               |
| CNPJ              | 12.345.678/0001-90           |
| Email             | usuario@email.com            |
| Password          | A1b@3456                     |
| Phone Number      | (11) 99999-9999              |
| Credit Card       | 5555 4444 3333 2222          |

Detection combines regular expressions with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), ensuring high accuracy even on unstructured text.
